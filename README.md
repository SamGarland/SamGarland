# About

## Intro

I am a highly trained and experienced horticulturist, with a keen interest in making a career move into software development. I currently work as Head Gardener at the Bishopâ€™s House Garden, Norwich, but I have been learning Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS for the last year and would like to move into a junior/graduate position. I have recently undertaken an intensive software development bootcamp with HyperionDev, in which I have enhanced my abilities in Python, HTML and CSS, as well as learning some Django and Bootstrap, and gaining experience of MySQL/SQLite3, Git and GitHub. I am also most of the way through a comprehensive full-stack web development course on Udemy, in which I have focused on building upon my skills in Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I am motivated, hard working and intelligent, and I relish the opportunity to keep learning and solve interesting problems on a day-to-day basis.
