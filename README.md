# About

## Intro

I am most interested in the fields of novel software engineering and machine learning. I am currently undertaking a part-time MSc in Computing Science at UEA, with modules in database manipulation, programming with Python, statistical methods, data mining, artificial intelligence and dissertation project. I completed a bootcamp in software engineering, predominantly programming with Python using OOP principles, for which I gained a mark of 100%. I have also been learning programming in a web environment through online courses, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Django, MySQL.

As I also have a Philosophy background from my BA and MA, I am very interested in the philosophical issues surrounding the use of artificial intelligence. In particular, I am fascinated by the ethical and political considerations for implementing these technologies, and I have recently written about the risks of ML models reinforcing existing societal biases.
